Simple elevation profile (elpro) service similar to google's elevation
service [1].

Demo installation using freeDEM [2] data:

http://karme.de/elevation-profile/demo?path=48.5,9|48.5,9.1&upsample=100&format=svg

(additional) features:

- open source

- seamless stacking of multiple DEMs (it is really simple to add
  another DEM dataset if the format is supported by gdal [3])

- upsample polyline (keeping original input points and inserting
  equidistant additional points if needed)

- wgs84 spheroid distance calculations

If http overhead is a problem you might wish to use the elpro tool
providing a simple command line interface. You can use it either
directly via pipes or in combination with good old (x)inetd [4,5] or
socat [6]. For xinetd an example configuration is included and
installed by default. The default configuration binds to 127.0.0.1
only. If you want to limit access to a specific user on localhost you
can try using ident and hosts.allow/deny (unfortunately the lua socket
library doesn't support unix domain sockets). The lua client example
in lua/ uses socat.
